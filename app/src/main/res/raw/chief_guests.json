            "Description": "Professor C. D. Mote, Jr. is President of the National Academy of Engineering and Regents Professor on leave from\nthe University of Maryland, College Park. Dr. Mote earned his BS, MS, and PhD degrees at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley in mechanical engineering between 1959 and 1963. After a postdoctoral year in England and\nthree years as an assistant professor at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, he returned to Berkeley\nto join the faculty in mechanical engineering for the next 31 years. He and his students investigated the dynamics,\nstability, and control of high-speed rotating and translating continua as well as biomechanical problems emanating\nfrom snow skiing. He coined the area called dynamics of axially moving materials encompassing these systems.\nFifty-eight PhD students earned their degrees under his mentorship.\n\nAt Berkeley, he held an endowed chair in mechanical systems and served as chair of the mechanical engineering\ndepartment from 1987 to 1991 when the National Research Council (NRC) ranked its graduate program\neffectiveness highest nationally. Because of his success at raising funds for mechanical engineering, in 1991 he was\nappointed vice chancellor at Berkeley expressly to create and lead a $1 billion capital campaign for the campus that\nultimately reached $1.4 billion.\n\nIn 1998, Dr. Mote was recruited to the presidency of the University of Maryland, College Park, a position he held\nuntil 2010 when he was appointed Regents Professor. His goal for the university was to elevate its self-expectation\nof achievement and its national and global position through proactive initiatives. During his tenure, the number of\nAcademy members among the faculty tripled, three Nobel laureates were recognized, and an accredited school of\npublic health and a new department of bioengineering were created. He also founded a 130-acre research park next\nto the campus, faculty research funds increased by 150%, and partnerships with surrounding federal agencies and\nwith international organizations expanded greatly. The number of students studying abroad tripled, and he\ncreated an annual open house day that has attracted over 100,000 visitors per day, founded a charitable foundation\nfor the campus whose board of trustees launched a $1 billion capital campaign that reached its goal.\n\nDr. Mote\u2019s recognitions include the NAE Founders Award, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Medal,\nand the Humboldt Prize of the Federal Republic of Germany. At the University of California, Berkeley, he was\nhonoured with the Distinguished Teaching Award, Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award, Berkeley Citation,\nand Excellence in Achievement Award. He is an Honorary Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers, and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Mechanics, the\nAcoustical Society of America and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
